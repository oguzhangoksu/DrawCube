## In this project, I implemented a cut corner cube using different rendering techniques. The project is developed with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, showcasing various methods to represent the cube. Users can interact with the cube by rotating, scaling, and translating it, and can switch between different rendering algorithms such as backface culling and painting.
